# Using Hilt in your Android app

- This folder originally contains the source code for the "Using Hilt in your Android app" codelab.
It was extended to have more integration with the other Architecture components like ViewModel, Navigation Components...
to showcase more ideas on using Hilt in an Android application.


# Introduction
Dependency injection is a technique widely used in programming and well suited
to Android development. By following the principles of dependency injection, you
lay the groundwork for a good app architecture.

Implementing dependency injection provides you with the following advantages:
* Reusability of code.
* Ease of refactoring.
* Ease of testing.


# Pre-requisites
* Experience with Kotlin syntax.
* You understand Dependency Injection.

# Getting Started
1. Install Android Studio, if you don't already have it.
2. Download the sample.
3. Import the sample into Android Studio.
4. Build and run the sample.
